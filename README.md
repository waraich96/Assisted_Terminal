# Assisted_Terminal

Assisted Terminal is an “Assisted” bash terminal, written in Python 3. The Assisted Terminal supplements the normal Linux bash shell by prompting users for commands and guides them through different kinds of activities and exercises with the use of a storyline. 

Assisted Terminal provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Linux and Unix based systems, with an emphasis on command-line control.

Assisted Terminal operates as a text-based learning game that can be used by students for self-learning or within the classroom, where it could prevent the need for teachers to stand over the shoulders of students. While still being able to hold their hand and walk them through technical material.
